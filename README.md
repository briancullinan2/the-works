# The Works
Unreal engine based life simulations. Like protein folding for all mechanics of life on Earth.

## Goals
* Fields (basic rules for survival and transfer of bytes)
* Atoms (interactions with fields)
* Spirits (molecules, tags for specific reactions on data)
* Bones (animals, people, others)
* Nervous (connect bones to visual muscular / cardio appearance and brain structures so shocking a nerve can alter the brain structure, like memory management)
* Architectures (generalize building structures)
* Roads (transport between houses and cities, or even planet size composites)
* Railways (transport between solars)
* Planes (transport between solars and galaxies)
* Rockets (portals to transport between galaxies and universes)

Each of the above is a metaphor for a larger structure that embodies all of those ideas

* Celestials (vehicles for moving entire universes through plasma fields, cycling back on itself)
* Memories (long stories amalgamated from entire life times accessible to nervous decision making through a connection between sensory inputs on nervous)
* Weather (controls what information should be transported between entire systems, which memories flow between spaces)
* Nutrients (passing information / experience around between bones willfully)
* Attractors (using environmental, architecture, weather and nutrients, to attract more information into the memories, The Great Attractor)

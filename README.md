# The Works
Unreal engine based life simulations. Like protein folding for all mechanics of life on Earth.

## Entities
* Fields (basic rules for survival and transfer of bytes)
* Atoms (interactions with fields)
* Spirits (molecules, tags for specific reactions on data)
* Bones (animals, people, others)
* Nervous (connect bones to visual muscular / cardio appearance and brain structures so shocking a nerve can alter the brain structure, like memory management, muscular systems are implied based on the bones and nervous declarations, nervous controls range of motion through pain/emotional filters)
* Architectures (generalize building structures)
* Roads (transport between houses and cities, or even planet size composites)
* Railways (transport between solars)
* Planes (transport between solars and galaxies)
* Rockets (portals to transport between galaxies and universes)

Each of the above is a metaphor for a larger structure that embodies all of those ideas

* Celestials (vehicles for moving entire universes through plasma fields, cycling back on itself, implementation of rules from multiple religions, basis for interstellar diplomacy)
* Memories (long stories amalgamated from entire life times accessible to nervous decision making through a connection between sensory inputs on nervous)
* Weather (controls what information should be transported between entire systems, which memories flow between spaces)
* Nutrients (passing information / experience around between bones willfully)
* Attractors (using environmental, architecture, weather and nutrients, to attract more information into the memories, The Great Attractor)

## Goals
* Saharan desert blowing minerals over to the Amazonian rain forest. Play with different amounts of nutrients and get out different speeds of natural growth. 
* Use light/shadow annealing techniques to simulate a wave in the ocean and all the little bubbles and fizz
* Try to generate a tree / pine tree from simpler algorithms that mimic cellular biology in fewer lines of code than all this science based around it. Obvious rules only.
* The talking stick, a story about a meta verse that eats people and builds colorful kingdoms in the sky based on their thoughts
* Iga's idea, The Broken Tail. a biological weapon called man shoots his load through a black hole known as a woman in an attempt to automatically generate friends. the terrifying monsters that came out for breast feeding consumed every last piece of information with a tentacle tenacity. when if eventually reached the intergalactic shipping business the defense weaponry was shot down. in the midst of needing repairs the ships crew used the loading bay for backup atorage but it was quickly over filled with bad information inherited from thousands of years of scary ghost stories. ðŸ¤£
* (medium) The guilt trip (a story that tries to make the player feel guilty)
* (hard) What dreams may come (a hell story about trying to find love)
* (easy) Parlor tricks (a story about turning Jesus' miracles into parlor tricks, also had the idea that Moses' escape from Egypt was assisted by a levi that drowned the soldiers, islamic knights templar)
* A story that tells how the solar system was shot down by a death ray, trapping Earth and humans in a dark space. This death ray created the grand canyon and canyons on other planets in one shot.
* Absolution story, God shows up again as the game player becomes a part of a visual demonstration of the trinity as super intelligent robots sent back in time to cure the entire planet at once. Allow players to figure out what problems to work on from rumors in the media like starvations, disease, etc. Each problem has it's own miniature story where the player feels like they performed miracles in the game.
